Q. let's have a quick discussion on what you did and what you did not so let's just get started so give me a quick
intro 

A. yeah like basically I'm from Kerala and myself Muhammad ashik and I'm working as a cloudops engineer devops 
engineer since last years like uh so initially I joined as an O engineer like I was doing like some kind of monitoring
and reble shooting that kind of activity so then interally I moved into AWS devops engineer so now I have a good
experience on like a kubernetes Docker Docker swam and Docker compos files and as well as like eks ECS so when it come
to Azure also have some exposure and recently I started learning gcp as well so when it come to AWS part I have a
good experience in like VPC and ec2 part and as well as Route 53 and yes three I
am and Cloud front and load balancer Auto scaling and these all are actually have a good experience on it and I was
doing some trible shooting as well on that so when it come to this Azure part I have a good experience on load balance
or Auto scaling so they actually be using like we have a four kind of load balancer one is a CD and then traffic
manager we have a load balanc we application Gateway and when it come to firewall firewalls also have a good
experience and I have a good experience in between like integration between AWS and Azure integration by using sample
and SSO based authentication have a good experience to connect VPN connection between AWS and on premise connection so
have a knowledge so this is actually my exposure into that 


Q. okay uh so let me just ask you
quick thing uh so in your latest project most you working in some project right correctly what is your role what exactly
do you do like that just want to know the role 

A. got it got it so actually the role in the sense whatever the
requirement actually be getting so regarding to the actual we have to work like yesterday actually we had a requirement see we actually be creating
a new cluster so to create a new cluster actually we have some prerequisite for example actually we have to do jenin SSO
so we already have a AWS account but actually we have to create a single signing on for that so team leader actually he's assigned the ticket and I
just done that so actually basically I don't know how to do that but actually we have to refer and we have to do that
same as like uh like see for example bit backet so there is a no MFA so we have to enable the MFA and like last week
actually I created a deployment and service Ingress Rule and all I created like last week itself so that is the
work like according to the requirement so team leader either he will assign the ticket or else I will sell first and then I will like attach it like I will
do like that 


Q. okay cool very good um so uh do you have any uh knowledge on
programming languages any experience on that or what kind of programming languages you know yeah 

A. I heard like I had experience like uh in Python and as
well as like Java I was doing previously like when I was was doing my graduation at that time like B and all that time so
then now I'm not doing but even though I have like a good knowledge on Python and as well as shell scripting also I'm
learning now and Java completely I left but Python and Sh scripting I follow him right now 


Q. okay uh okay so then uh if I'm going
give I'm going to give you a quick question let's see how you can solve this uh so it's it's a very simple
one so I have an array right I have an array uh it's starting with like it has a multiple numbers couple numbers and
then it has duplicates of numbers inside it but the problem here is that also along with the duplicates I have it
in jumbled order I want to make it in ascending order so what's the what's the approach going to be for this 

A. so I think actually there we can use tle so when it come to python
actually we have a different different kinds of aray for example list we have a tle and we have a sets we have a dictionary so by using tle actually we
can achieve this I'm not sure about that because I already told you know but actually we can use tle see if it come
to list actually it's unordered right UN in the sense we can put one then after we can put zero so that is uned we can
like we can do that 

it's not an list I'm talking about array here H so uh so if I
if I don't um go towards the topple part I just want to know what kind of
algorithm will you use like first actually we need to make first we need to make it order right
should I first remove the duplicates or should I arrange in ascending order and why 

so okay so first we can remove the
duplicates that we can do that so we can create a for Loop then we can check like first we will take the I value okay each
value we will take so if the value is a present so we will keep over there and second time also is present we will remove that value so that we can do the
first we can do like that and second uh in second condition so we can create if condition that we can check greater than
less than like so first we will take the I value then we will check the some condition okay so if it is greater than that okay then we will remove okay or
else we been place in front of that all be place in like beside that so that we can create like we can create if condition as well for
over 

Q. okay interesting uh so you you told that you know sell scripting 

ahh that also I'm started learning now yes but you can you started learning on okay uh
let's let's see how much you have learned so so suppose um suppose your
manager is asking you that you have a thousand thousand numbers right thousand
numbers and uh but uh so basically it's like it's like suppose you have a list
there which is like ABC colon one okay and the next one is suppose BCD colon 5
okay right and what I want is I just want the
numbers I just want the numbers I do not I I do not need those ABC colon the St part so how to achieve this and what do
you think the algo should be for to achieve this so like actually uh we have a lot of option for that for example
first we can use SD command stream editor by using SD command actually we can filter the content and as well as we
can replace so for example like I I'll give a scenario for that so first we can
use SD or else we have another option like awk awk actually it's a kind of
like a cutting tool so we can use that we can specify field editor then we can specify the space or comma and we can
cut that after like okay second column third column fourth column so that we can use like awk or CD I have experience
on it so what do what will you remove and what will you take as a placeholder
okay placeholder so you saying so you saying you will remove something but what what
will you use to remove that okay sir actually in our question okay uh like uh
so we only record the numbers right yeah it's it's like ABC colon one and then BCD col
okay then we can use like U that column we can use over there I'm think so colon we can use as a field editor we can use
a colon okay but then suppose uh someone did a mistake inside it and suppose we
have BCD colon and then before five there is another colon okay sorry before
before so I have So currently we have BCD colon 5 okay BCD but suppose we have
BCD colon colon five there's like an extra colon inside it okay then we can create a condition if it is a colon one
colon and as well as two colon or as multiple colon so we have to take the number only so that we can specify that
we can create a condition over there are you sure H we can use a condition like see so suppose consider
you have a multiple condition so definitely we have to use a condition if statement else statement then again we have to use El if statement so we can
use a condition over there if it is a multiple conditions okay interesting okay uh oh
that's about I think uh that's that's that's good enough let's just move on to the actual devop part so um you have
knowledge on Docker right so can you just uh can do do you now know how to
8:09
write a doer file I know I syntax of do file you know right so just tell me a quick syntax quick deployment of engx
8:16
image or Java image or something just tell me what will be the synx in Docker file we will be have instruction
8:22
argument so first we have to start from the base image so I will specify capital from so I will take the base image so
8:29
consider I'm going to take your abund over here so next I will create a copy or else I can take whatever sorry first
8:35
I will do one thing I will just create a small uh like uh like Docker file like by using engine as you told okay so
8:42
first that's fine that's fine okay sir so first I will create a like from base
8:47
image so that I will choose engine so then I will use copy command so I can copy one like HTML file from my local
8:53
system to my uh container so that I can use copy then space I can specify the
8:59
index index file name then space I can specify the path like slash user then
9:04
slash then I can specify the amount path what is my Mount path of my engine X container then if I want I can specify
9:10
user like so when I'm creating a container the container should be run on this particular user so by default it
9:15
will be take root user but I can use any other mic user joone user with a lease permission so same as I can provide
9:22
expose in one Current Port actually actually I can mention over there for example port number 80 or 81 82 I can
9:28
specify that I can spe maintainer as well so if I want I can do that argument and we have like a lot of option like
9:34
entry point we have CMD we have and entry point actually when a containers are starting so this command will be
9:39
executed and CMD actually is the argument of this entry point anyway entry point is going to execute first
9:45
then then only the CMD will be execute so like we can yeah okay uh interesting
9:50
so uh what is you mentioned about exposed what is it doing exactly exactly
9:56
see for example our container when container is a starting so that is going to working in this particular p number
10:02
but before actually one thing we have to make ensure when we creating our engine in engine code programming code we have
10:08
to mention the port number then only we can mention this the same port in our Docker F then only it will work or else
10:14
it will not work are you sure so you're saying that we have to explicitly write expose
10:21
inside our do no no no that is not mandatory but we have to do that for example I will give one more like from
10:27
my experience I will tell you that see when I was creating a tom cat image so at that time actually we don't need to
10:32
run the Tomcat on port number 880 actually I want to run the port number on 1001 okay so what I done over there I
10:37
created a tomcat Tomcat image while I'm creating the image I went to the server.xml file the programming that
10:44
source code there I went to that file then I created the part number from 80 82 then 1,1 then I went to my um uh this
10:52
itself like my doer file itself then I exposed my port number 1,001 so now it's working p number th1 instead of p number
10:58
880 so that's what m we have to mention that then only it will work I think are
11:03
you sure H sir like when we create him from scratch from scratch actually we have to mention that but already created
11:09
image actually we know need to mention for example when I'm creating Enix image I know need to mention that but when I'm creating from scratch I'm I'm creating a
11:16
tomcat image from scratch so at that time I have to mention um so when you're saying expose
11:23
what what what does that mean I'm not able to understand what you what exactly you mean by Expose okay expose in the
11:30
sense like see suppose if you want to connect the container so the container should be open in a port right so that's
11:35
what we need to enable one port number so we will be have a port number from 1 to 65,535 so we need to assign one port for
11:43
one particular port for then only we can access that so we'll be have two port number one is a host Port another one is a container Port so host Port so we can
11:50
access our virtual machine privately or publicly so by using that particular port number so once our virtual machine
11:56
connected then from this port particular port to it will connect our container port number because in that virtual
12:01
machine we will be have a 10,000 Port like 10,000 containers so we need to distinguish these containers by using
12:07
this port number so that's why we using expose then what is the use of
12:13
publish publish I'm exposing it by why I expose then why am I using publisher
12:18
also oh publish actually I don't know sir actually I'm not aware about that okay so okay so tell me tell me a quick
12:26
Docker run command Docker run command okay Docker run then space we can specify the image name then space uh
12:32
sorry Docker run then space minus D then we can space like minus v as a volume so minus p as a port number then we can
12:38
specify the image name and that is going to run the image on our local system or virtual machine wherever it is what is
12:45
minus P minus P port number so we can specify the port number over the map now what is the full form of P
12:52
Port okay so of minus p is not Port it's publish okay that P is publish okay
12:59
actually I thought it's minus P support I'm sorry for that that's fine that's fine that's that's what I was asking so
13:05
uh just to clarify here you are saying about exposing the port with the help of expose Command right okay correct uh
13:12
that's not true so it's when you're mentioning inside Docker file that expose command you basically writing
13:18
that for documentation purpose okay it does not like it does not actually do
13:24
anything okay okay for to expose to actually expose the port or publish the port on the host machine you have to
13:30
publish it okay okay and to publish it you have to mention that hyphen P okay okay go go it go it actually I thought
13:37
so even if you're not mentioning that expose in our Docker file it will not work so I thought like that no even if
13:45
you do not mention expose it will work I mean as long as you are publishing it when you're running the image okay okay
13:52
go it go thank you thank you for the information okay okay uh that's I think
13:58
okay U uh let's just go through some more questions on Docker what is a volume volume basically like see
14:05
whatever the containers are storing so that we can keep in our volume itself so we have two types of volume so either we
14:11
can mount by using bind Mount or else we can use volume Mount we can use it as a persistent
14:17
volume um interesting so uh when you say Mount um what what does it actually do
14:25
so Mount see whatever the path like in container we will be have a particular path so there actually we going to keep
14:31
our old files for example if it is a database we'll be have a SQL file over there so if it is a web server we'll be
14:36
have index.htm index PHP file over there so that path path actually we need to mount our local system so that's what we
14:42
using Mount okay okay now suppose you have already mounted it right and then um
14:49
suppose you have you exer into that container and then you go inside that part and then suppose you create a text
14:55
file inside it are you sure it's going to reflect in the host
15:01
definitely definitely okay interesting interesting now suppose you are inside the host and you create the text file
15:08
inside the host part okay will it reflect in the container part uh definitely that also will be happen
15:13
because for that we have to create persistent volume like we either we have to create bind Mount or else volume Mount so we can create a volume inside
15:20
our Docker directory like then we can map it then after we can go to either local system or as we can go to our
15:27
container then we can create the file automatically the file will be generated local system in and as well as inside a
15:33
container okay interesting um so let's move on to uh Jenkins do you know
15:39
Jenkins have you worked on Jenkins yes correct sir okay uh do you know how to write a Jenkins file yes sir yeah uh
15:46
what is a choice parameter Choice parameter actually I'm not aware about that like if you do you know about
15:52
parameters in genin h parameters parameters I know like we can specify the parameters and we can call as
15:58
enironment variable like that uh interesting when you're saying envirment variables because we also have
16:05
a in command inside the genkins file which will take the envir so why use parameters par I'm not sure about that
16:12
the difference between an environment variable and paramet but both actually fine that's fine that's fine that's
16:19
that's that's fine okay you're saying about integration of genkin with SSO I I was intrigued with that uh so uh okay so
16:27
when you okay so so how are you doing exactly that I'm quite interested with that so like how are you doing it okay
16:34
so see basically we will be have one credential one usern and password so the user can access to aw's account and as
16:41
well as any other application so mainly be using bitbucket and G GitHub and as well as we have genkins so we have some
16:47
other platform as well so the user can access to multiple AWS account and as well as these all application by using
16:53
same credential so that's what I created this SSO for genkins so for that we have
16:58
to install one plugin s okayl security ass markup language plugin that we can
17:04
that is available in like genin itself so we can go to manage then plugin then we can install the plugin so once we
17:10
install the plug-in then we have to go to aw account that we have to create a SSO login credential we have to create
17:16
over there so once we create once we create the SSO then we'll be get one URL so when we accessing when we clicking
17:22
the genins from AWS it should be redirect to work right so we have to get the link and we have to go to the genins
17:28
in genins we will be get a console itself when we once we install the sample based plugin so that we have to
17:33
past off with it so not only that actually we have to go please that's fine that's fine thank you thank you I
17:40
got to know about that um uh okay um okay about about slaves do you know
17:47
what is a Jenkin slave yes sir what is that slave basically actually worker not
17:52
only like the master will be instruct and worker nde will be take the instruction and it will do the process
17:57
for example so we have a three process and we want to run this three proc three process so it can be run in a master
18:04
only but actually we can distribute the load between these three node like we can like do that same as our master and
18:10
slave concept okay now uh so so you're saying that no builds will run on Master uh
18:17
sorry sir ah build build also will be run are you sure H so when you're saying you you have
18:24
slaves but you have uh you have a master also and then the builds are running if you don't mention it in the Jenkins file
18:31
or the build or the pipeline it's going to run on Master also no no no no like in genin F actually we have to mention
18:38
instead of agent any we have to mention the particular node name like node name or agent is equal to node this node
18:44
actually we have to mention then only this process will be working on over there okay okay interesting um let's
18:51
move on to kubernetes because that's the whole agenda of this um so what is a
18:58
config file Cube config file basically suppose if you want to connect your cluster so we we need to authenticate
19:05
first for the authentication actually we will be have a file do config file so each user will be like what other user
19:10
has to access our cluster the user will be have one directory and directory will be dot config inside do config will be
19:16
have a file config file so that config file will be contain like user and cluster and contacts like this kind of
19:22
information will be there interesting so suppose you're saying that uh suppose you have created
19:28
a cluster okay and suppose I get hold of that Cube config file so that means I also have full access to your cluster
19:35
like uh how is it sir okay no problem can you so uh suppose you created a cluster right so now then then you get a
19:42
cube config file of your cluster correct now suppose uh by accident or by
19:48
something I got hold of that Cube config file okay so are you saying that I have
19:54
full access to your a cluster now so if it is an administrator like a privilege then we can also access it because see
20:00
the same the same directory actually we have to copy and we have to go to the particular user then we have to paste off the like a cube config that
20:07
particular directory so then that user also can access because by default that that file will be have the permissions
20:13
one certificate and one context and one user will be there then we can access
20:19
what is the context context in the S like uh we can call it as a different different like cluster we can call it as
20:25
a context like uh so different different name space also we call it as a
20:32
context say it again I'm bit confused you saying names space can be cont
20:37
context context in the sense like so different different cluster we will call it as a
20:43
context uh not really uh so so that you're partially correct but you're like
20:49
20% correct here I'm having some confusion on it I thought like different different cluster we'll call it as a
20:54
Contex for example so I have a cluster one so that is a Contex one Contex and cl to that is another context like that
21:00
I I I learned like that that's what that's that's true that's that's what I'm saying you like 20% true the actual
21:07
meaning here is that suppose um suppose you have a genkins right suppose you have genkins and you are deploying it
21:13
some in some kubernetes clusters but the problem here is that now suppose you have like 10 kubernetes clusters right
21:20
and then but you have only one gen okay so then the issue is that I have 10
21:25
clusters but instead of having 10 Cube config file suppose I have only one Cube config file okay right so that means you
21:33
can have at least one Cube config file and you can change that context and you can after changing the context you can
21:39
deploy it in your respective clusters okay so that's what you were saying but
21:44
actually here the point is that uh it's about the cont so of course cuberes
21:51
clusters each cuberes clusters will have one context but the point here is that
21:57
one Cube config file can have multiple contexts and we can switch between the those context to deploy our changes okay
22:03
that also we can do that yeah right uh okay interesting uh so uh tell me about
22:09
pods what is a pod okay pod is a like most basic unit in kubernetes so each Bo
22:15
will be have one container or multiple containers then then by that stance a
22:21
container is just smallest unit right correct container is the smallest unit but actually we cannot create a container inside a kubernetes for that
22:28
actually we have to create a p most basically interesting uh interesting so do you know what is
22:34
container ah container D that's it right what is that uh that's I think low low
22:41
level functions so if you want to call any uh function so we have to call first container D from container D it will
22:46
call the lowest function from the container okay so do you know what kind of database cuties uses so database hcd
22:55
like distributable what is etcd etcd is a kind of database so we can store like
23:00
all information over there in a key value pair like so when you're saying key value pair what type of database it
23:06
ISL I think so distrib distribut
23:12
right uh okay I'm giving you two options it is either MySQL or I mean like it's a
23:18
SQL or no SQL what is that so that is uh no SQL interesting why did you say no SQL
23:27
because my if it is a my it will store in like a tables and draws but is it noq it will store in documents that's what
23:33
correct uh okay what is the difference between a config map and a secret like config Mac actually we can create
23:39
environment variables over there for example non sensitive information we can store in config Mac when it come to secret actually we can store password
23:46
username or else some secret information we can keep the sensitive informations uh so when when I'm using
23:53
Secrets does that mean that it is automatically encrypted no no no so we have to create encryption configuration for that then only it will encrypt in
23:59
hcd database then what is secret doing so secret basically so it will like convert
24:06
into base 64 so for that actually we have to use like EO space minus and then we have to specify the username then one
24:12
GP then we have to use base 64 that will encod encoded into uh like a Bas 64 then
24:18
we have to Eng grip that yes sir um okay um what
24:25
um so suppose I have a secret and I am base 64 encoding it in the cluster okay
24:33
right now um then I mean anybody who has access to the cluster can decode it
24:39
right so if they have a permission into access hcd then they can do that and as well as they can decode it like once
24:46
they get once they get get the encoded data so they they can decode it by using echospace minus and then when GP then
24:54
decode minus minus decode they can just mention over there and it will be decoded to the previous whatever the plane text actually be given it will
25:01
decode then what do you think is it is it actually secure or we can make it more secure no so that is not as secure
25:08
because once they get this uh encoded value if they know the idea like opposite idea how to decode it they can
25:14
simply they can mention they can decode it but along with that actually we have to do the encryption configur configuration as well then only it will
25:20
encrypt in our uh like hcd database so that we should do and as well as so like
25:25
we can use like Hashi cor as well along with that like if we store storing that information like a BCS or somewhere so
25:31
we can create Hashi cor configuration like sorry Hashi cor world we can use and we can engri like a secrets and some
25:37
kind of information over there so you're saying interesting so you're saying you
25:42
we will use hashy C right no I'm not using actually somewhere actually read this so we can use it along with
25:47
actually we can merge it somewhere actually read this that's that's fine that's fine I mean I mean that's fine you have not uh did a hands-on
25:54
experience on that but that's interesting that you know about it but I just want to go through this discussion
26:00
so suppose I'm using this Hashi card Vault right and then I'm keeping all
26:05
hundreds of Secrets and values and everything in that Vault okay but again
26:10
how to access that Vault with the from the cluster okay how Okay so for that definitely we'll be have a p and this P
26:17
should be have some service account and we need to assign the service account and permission all we have to create so whichever the name space actually it's
26:24
using so we have to create a like role or cluster role we can give a cluster scope we can create so then later it can
26:30
access it tell me again uh that's not true just
26:36
just think about just think about it for like 10 seconds and just come up with the solution of suppose I have a Hashi
26:42
card V right and I'm giving hundreds of keys there okay but the issue is I mean
26:47
even even after I've kept everything I need to access it somehow and to access it we I have to have a secret key or
26:55
something correct ex so then what am I going to do with that so definitely in
27:00
has actually we need to authenticate first hashy Corp Vault so for that we'll be have a token over there so we have to
27:06
get the token and then we have to authenticate an over here right so I'm thinking like that we because without authenticate to Hashi we cannot do that
27:13
so in Hashi cor pack we we can create different different Secrets I think okay so you're saying token right
27:21
so where will where will I keep the token to make it secure uh the token actually I'm not sure so anyway we have
27:26
to take the token from hash only then only we can authenticate by using that but I'm not
27:32
sure interesting so I have kept everything inside it but again anywh I'm
27:38
keep I have the token and I'm making it like insecure and I'm keeping it somewhere inside the Pod correct yes but
27:45
I'm confused okay interesting so so the solution here is that uh anyway I have
27:52
the token right I have to keep it somewhere okay so do you know what is the concept of a init container init
27:57
container I know I know what is that so init container basically that is going to initialize before the actual
28:04
container is running okay uh so here only that is the main main important thing is the init
28:11
container will be responsible for transferring all our tokens and whatever the hashiko needs inside the application
28:17
P then it will die okay so that means in run time it will push it everything inside the cont and it will die that
28:23
means I do not have anything lying around inside the P okay okay okay go it go that's the solution just think about
28:29
it when you after this interview and then you will be able to understand it better okay corre okay uh do you know
28:36
what is the persistent volume and how is it actually different from Docker volumes uh persistent volume I know like
28:43
uh H persistent volume we can create first we have to create a PV like persistent volume we have to create to
28:49
connect with the p deployment we have to create a persistent volume climb so that we have to do like when it come to
28:55
Docker so we don't need to create any persistent volume clim we only need to create the volume then after we can map
29:01
this our local system volume with our container Mount we can do that but when it come to again this kubernetes
29:07
actually we have one more component that's a persistent volume climb so we have to climb with our P or
29:13
deployment clim from where uh from persistent volume local system only but where is this persistent
29:19
volume coming from so we can use like Port works or else we can use Amazon EBS or else we can use like EFS we can use
29:26
for that like this kind of storage we can Ed for that interesting um
29:33
okay uh okay so then uh okay so you are mentioning that we are we will be using
29:38
eks and not not EBS it's we will be using EBS or some some kind of os discs
29:44
right yes so then uh do you know what is the concept of storage class uh storage
29:50
class storage class actually uh we EBS actually we have a storage class we can use EBS and one more thing sir actually
29:56
uh 4:00 actually have to relo in so I'm getting a call as okay no problem
30:01
problem 33 4 no problem just uh I can we can finish
30:08
this interview here uh just just to round up here um do you have any any questions for me uh no sir actually
30:14
could you please write actually how was interview and all I mean I will write it I I have to
30:20
analyze everything and then I have to like ask my manager I put all my points to him and then he will review it and
30:26
then he will proceed I mean I have no Authority here okay my duty is just to
30:31
jot down everything and then make a note of everything and then I have to like review it from a manager and then he
30:37
will okay proceed further right okay so that's about it anything else no sir no
30:43
nothing thank you thank you for your time thank you you can drop off now thank you thank you so much thank you
30:53

32:55
[Music]
33:12
seens SE video
33:21
interview H yes ma'am I have S you one new me on your nor number so you can
33:28
join she on call okay I think she's connected now M hello uh hello
33:35
ma'am hi M hi ma'am ma'am is it visible or not ma'am uh no it's visible
33:43
okay all right all right so we can start with your introduction okay okay uh
33:50
ma'am uh basically I'm from Cara and my name is Muhammad ashik and so I'm working since last 3 years as a deop
33:57
like I have relevant experience in devops 1.5 years so when it come to devops I have a good knowledge in eks
34:02
ECS and Docker kubernetes when it come to Docker I have a good knowledge in Docker swam and Docker Combos and Docker
34:09
stack and out so like when it come to aw SP again so I have a good experience in AWS load balancer and E2 and networking
34:16
part and sight to site VPN connection and openvpn climent connection and S based authentication based on Azure and
34:23
AWS VPN and again like Route 53 and Cloud front and yes three and so these
34:28
all I have a good experience so when it come to Azure part I have a good experience with Azure virtual machine
34:33
Azure virtual networks and uh Azure side to S side recovery and as well as sorry
34:39
Azure side to side connection and Azure Recovery Service VA Azure Mar and map s and how to take a backup from Azure to
34:46
on premise like I have a good experience on it okay okay so you have worked in AWS
34:55
or Azure like both they work like Azure actually recently started like I think a couple of months ago like 6 months ago
35:01
but I'm working as a devops engineer okay and what is the 6D
35:08
Technologies could you just explain me a bit about this organization ah currently I'm working over I said a
35:15
options so what do the 6D Technologies what what does they do like actually we
35:20
have an application like basically I'm supporting one client only so we have an application it's a book publishing application so I'm supporting them like
35:27
whatever the requirement they have like they have a production environment and preproduction environment staging environment so team leader he will
35:32
assign the tickets and So based on that I will I will do the work like uh last week actually we had a cluster clean
35:39
like we need to clean the cluster like it was an old cluster so that was the work last
35:45
week okay and is it a service based company or a product based company service service based
35:50
company and what is the team size around uh so in AWS actually we have around six
35:56
members and devops we have three members so including me three members no no what is the team I mean what is the company
36:02
size company size around 500 or 600 I think so total based out
36:09
sorry where is it based out at it's based Bangalore only Bangalore like BTM
36:16
itself Okay you're from South right I'm from South only Kerala and mostly actually they working Mal is only in
36:22
company like okay I mean but then which is which should be good for you exactly good only
36:29
but the problem is actually we cannot learn from from there like that's the problem so that's what actually I'm looking at Job chain as well so I want I
36:36
want to get a like a challenging role like same as how to do the deployment and everything so as of now also I'm
36:41
doing the deployment and everything but even though I'm not getting much exposure from that I think like that so that's what I thought okay can leave and
36:48
I'll be get much salary as well okay and you completed to Eng
36:53
Engineering in 2019 and post that you started your career with them so you have a gap of I think one year so what
37:00
were you doing in that one year after graduation not one year ma'am like 2019 September almost actually I was
37:06
completed my graduation then after actually my uncle actually is well settled in Bangalore and came to
37:11
Bangalore then I was doing this aw scores then I getting into 60 at that okay okay I think in between I took
37:20
around four to six month that's only okay so are you open for Pune
37:26
location M okay no no problem at all see already I got a offer from I'm okay with
37:31
that location as well so I already told so salary and as well as the designation
37:37
I'm morly looking to that so anywhere I'm able to relocate not a problem at
37:42
mhm okay how did how did you get to know about decode decode actually um I
37:48
applied as usual actually I started applying a and I got a call from deod so it's what it was very interesting and
37:55
actually applied for the first round and that was was very good and like
38:00
that okay so you you said that you also got an offer from good so why you not
38:07
interested to go with them why you're looking for more offers no no not like that ma'am already I got a offer and
38:13
already I put my paper as well but if I'm getting good opportunity based upon the designation so they're telling like
38:19
okay I have to manage AWS and devops okay if I'm getting good opportunity from decode and if it is a challenging
38:25
rout and if I'm getting more like like whatever it can be features from this company so definitely I'm okay with this
38:30
no problem okay okay and how was your
38:36
interview experience in the round one sorry ma'am how was your interview experience
38:41
in the round one round one actually exactly it was good man and I'm not able to answer I think one or two question
38:47
but rest everything was very good okay
38:54
okay and you don't have any knowledge on get right uh actually I have a knowledge
39:00
but actually I confused on it like he was asking like okay how to create a good Branch so actually I know the
39:06
answer but actually at that time actually I got confused so we can use git Branch then we can specify New
39:11
Branch name or else we can use get Branch then minus B then we can specify New Branch name so then he was asking
39:17
okay what is how to change G Branch name so we can use git Branch then space minus M then we can use Branch name same
39:23
as he was asking like how to push like push like that I know the answer but actually at that time I confused so now
39:28
I'm able to answer for the question okay yes okay all right are you
39:34
giving interviews with any other companies also like I I had like in previously I had but once I got the
